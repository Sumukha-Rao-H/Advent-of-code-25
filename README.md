# Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository! This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 challenge.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event featuring a series of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. It runs from December 1st through December 25th, with a new puzzle released each day. The puzzles cover a wide range of topics including:

- Algorithms and data structures
- Mathematical problem-solving
- String manipulation
- Graph traversal
- Dynamic programming
- And much more!

Each day's puzzle consists of two parts, with Part 2 typically being more challenging than Part 1.

## Repository Structure

```
Advent-of-code/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── 1-12-2025/               # December 1st, 2025 puzzle
│   ├── input.txt            # Puzzle input data
│   ├── main.py              # Solution implementation
└── ...
```

Each day's folder contains:
- **input.txt**: The puzzle input specific to my account
- **main.py**: Python solution for both parts of that day's puzzle

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
python 1-12-2025/main.py
```

Each solution is designed to:
1. Read the input from the corresponding `input.txt` file
2. Solve Part 1 and Part 2 of the puzzle
3. Output the results to the console

## Language

All solutions are written in **Python** for clarity and ease of implementation.

## Notes

- Each puzzle input is unique per participant. The `input.txt` files contain my personal inputs from adventofcode.com
- Solutions aim for correctness and readability over raw performance
- Comments are included in solutions to explain the approach and logic
